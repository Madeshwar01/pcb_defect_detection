The fabrication of printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a crucial step in the 
manufacturing of electronics, and errors in this process can result in broken equipment 
and large financial losses. Automated flaw detection systems are necessary since traditional 
manual inspection techniques are labor-intensive and prone to human mistakes. This paper 
provides a thorough analysis of current developments in PCB defect detection methods, 
with an emphasis on the fusion of deep learning, machine learning, and image processing 
approaches.
